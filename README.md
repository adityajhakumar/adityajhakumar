## 🚀 About Me

I'm Aditya Kumar Jha, currently pursuing my **B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** at **VIT Chennai** (2022–2026). I thrive on building innovative tech solutions, fusing engineering with imagination. Whether it's developing ML models, engineering autonomous systems, or authoring sci-fi novels — I'm always pushing boundaries.

I'm proficient in **Python, C, C++, Java**, and love working with frameworks like **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **React Native**. My philosophy? _“Code like an engineer. Dream like a writer.”_
