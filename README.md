## About Me

I'm Aditya Kumar Jha, currently pursuing my BTech in ECE at VIT Chennai. By day, I'm a full-time code wrangler, and by night, I transform into an intergalactic space explorer. My code is so clean, even my cat can't leave a hairball in it. I speak Python and Java because you never know when you'll need to debug on Qo'noS. Committing to excellence, one line of code at a time.

When I'm not pushing to master, you can find me mastering the art of coffee brewing ☕. Feel free to fork my life, but please, no pull requests in the kitchen! 🍕
