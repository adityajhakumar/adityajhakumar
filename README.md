## About Me

I'm Aditya Kumar Jha, currently pursuing my **B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** at **VIT Chennai** (2022 - 2026). By day, I'm a **full-time code wrangler**, and by night, I transform into an **intergalactic space explorer**. My code is so clean, even my cat can't leave a hairball in it. I primarily code in **Python, C, C++, and Java**. Committing to excellence, one line of code at a time.

When I'm not pushing to master, you can find me **mastering the art of coffee brewing ‚òï**. Feel free to fork my life, but please, no pull requests in the kitchen! üçï
