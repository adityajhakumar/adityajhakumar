## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **B.Tech ECE student at VIT Chennai** (2022–2026) who loves building products that solve real problems. From **AI-powered health platforms** to **autonomous vehicles**, I turn ideas into impactful solutions.

**What drives me?** The intersection of **engineering precision** and **creative innovation**. By day, I code ML models and embedded systems. By night, I write science fiction novels exploring futuristic worlds.

> *"Code like an engineer. Dream like a writer. Build like a founder."*
