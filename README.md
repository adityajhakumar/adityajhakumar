- 👋 Hi, I’m Aditya Kumar jha 
- 👀 VIT CHENNAI -26
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing my BTech in ECE 
🚀 Full-time code wrangler by day, intergalactic space explorer by night. My code is so clean, even my cat can't leave a hairball in it. I speak Python and  Java – because you never know when you'll need to debug on Qo'noS. Committing to excellence, one line of code at a time. When I'm not pushing to master, you can find me mastering the art of coffee brewing ☕. Feel free to fork my life, but please, no pull requests in the kitchen! 🍕 #CodeIsLife #CommitAndChill
